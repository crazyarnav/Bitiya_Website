              Bitiya was proud to support the efforts of Ms. Praveen Mira and her team for their Salaam Balak Trust. Established in 1993, the program aims at preventing young residents of the area from becoming street children. A major component of the outreach is need-based and demand-driven educational intervention, both formal and non-formal. Salaam Balak Trust runs five 24-hour full care shelters for children, one being devoted to girl children. These shelters provide the children security, a sense of home, and an opportunity to receive all the critical inputs of childhood. They aim at restoring the childhood in children besides instilling in them the values of independence and decision-making, education and social values and financial self-dependence to become mature and responsible citizens of the country and caring and responsive members of the society.
